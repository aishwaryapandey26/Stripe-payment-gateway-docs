# Stripe Payment Gateway Integration
Welcome to the **Stripe Payment Gateway Integration** project! This repository demonstrates how
to integrate Stripe's powerful and secure payment processing system into your application. It
provides step-by-step guidance on setting up the payment gateway, handling payments, and using
Stripe's APIs effectively.
> This project aims to showcase the integration of the Stripe API for seamless payment processing
and will be useful for developers looking to implement payment solutions in their applications.

## Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the Stripe payment gateway integration locally:
### Prerequisites
- Node.js / Python / Java installed
- Stripe account (for your API keys)
- Database setup
- Postman (optional for testing)
### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-payment-gateway.git
 cd stripe-payment-gateway
 ```
2. Install dependencies:
    For Node.js:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 For Python:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 For Java:
 ```bash
mvn install
 ```
3. Set up Stripe API Keys in `.env` file:
 ```bash
 STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
 STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
 ```
4. Start the server:
 For Node.js:
 ```bash

## Authentication
Stripe uses API keys for authentication. You will need to use your secret key when making requests
to the Stripe API.
- Secret Key: Used for creating charges, customers, etc.
- Publishable Key: Used for front-end integration (e.g., handling the payment form).
**Ensure that you do not expose your secret key in client-side code.**

## Payment Flow

2. **Create a Payment Intent**
